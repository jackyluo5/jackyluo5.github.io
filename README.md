# Jacky Luo Portfolio

This is my first iteration of my own portfolio that includes personal projects I have completed in the past. My portoflio follows a HTML/CSS template given by ThemeWagon where I add my own projects and biography. I have edited the given HTML/CSS code to display previous projects I have completed.
