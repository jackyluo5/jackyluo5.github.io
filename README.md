# Jacky Luo Portfolio

This is my first iteration of my own portfolio that includes personal projects I have completed in the past. My portoflio follows a HTML/CSS template given by ThemeWagon where I add my own projects and biography. I have edited the given HTML/CSS code to my understanding to display previous projects I have completed and uploaded to GitHub. I also included a biography of myself and socials for contact. I took out some features of the template that was a bit hard to understand from my knowledge and incorporated my own flare as to how I want my portfolio to look.
